# al-folio
A simple and clean [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics.

**al-folio** is based on [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio).
The original theme was published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and copyrighted under the MIT license.

### Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first fork the theme from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve # Add "--incremental" for faster incremental builds.
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, you can deploy it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by running the deploy script:

```bash
$ ./bin/deploy
```
